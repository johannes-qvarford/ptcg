# PTCG

This is a small web app made for myself.
The purpose is to be able to collect "virtual" pokemon cards from virtual packs without having to buy them. You are only allowed to get one pack per day. Collected cards can then be viewed in an album. Additional features may be added later.

This is currently a WIP and will probably change significantly before it's finished.

## Roadmap

Was going to scrape Bulbapedia for PTCG cards and packs, but the PokemonTCG project seems much nicer to use.
Will start by using the API, and maybe move towards bundling the data in the app instead at a later time. 

* ~~Scrape Bulbapedia for base set.~~
* ~~Package scraped data for web app.~~
* Open packs.
* View album.
* Login for single user.
* Registration.
* More card sets.
