# PTCG

This is a small web app made for myself.
The purpose is to be able to collect "virtual" pokemon cards from virtual packs without having to buy them. You are only allowed to get one pack per day. Collected cards can then be viewed in an album. Additional features may be added later.

This is currently a WIP and will probably change significantly before it's finished.
